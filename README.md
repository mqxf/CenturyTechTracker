# CenturyTechTracker
A tracker for teachers that use Century tech, it compares results to last time the teacher checked instead of dates, also calculates average time per question.

The only downside is that Century Tech displays time in days when it reaches that, so minute based accuracy cannot be done. I will add a "check from date" helper to avoid this in 1.0 release.
