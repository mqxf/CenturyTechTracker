# CenturyTechTracker
A tracker for teachers that use Century tech, it compares results to last time the teacher checked instead of dates, also calculates average time per question.

The only downside is that Century Tech displays time in days when it reaches that, so minute based accuracy cannot be done. For this you can set a note for the class, for example: "Check CT from April 6th onwards only." to help you, and you can store one note per class, I might add more later.
